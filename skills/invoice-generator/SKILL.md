## Step 1 — Collect Required Inputs

Ask the user for any missing information:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sender company | Yes | "PT Swiss Hospitality Consulting" or "Scalrize" |
| Client name | Yes | Full company name |
| Client contact | Optional | e.g. "Attn: Toby" |
| Invoice date | Yes | DD.MM.YYYY |
| Concerns | Yes | Short description, e.g. "Sales Training" |
| Line items | Yes | Description + price for each |
| Invoice currency | Yes | IDR, USD, EUR, CHF |
| Invoice number | Yes | Format: INV-YYYY-NNN (check existing files to auto-increment) |
| Payment split | Optional | e.g. "50% today, 50% before start" |
| Save location | Yes | Default depends on project context |

**If invoice currency is IDR:** Always ask "What is the current USD/IDR exchange rate?" — never use a cached rate.

No company address.

**Design system (use for all Scalrize invoices):**
- Logo: use horizontal logo at `Scalrize/Website/assets.Scalrize/company.logo.horizontal.jpg` — embed via `<img>` tag with absolute file path
- Heading font: Fraunces (serif) — load from Google Fonts: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:wght@600;700&family=DM+Sans:wght@400;500;600&display=swap`
- Body font: DM Sans (sans-serif)
- Colors:
  - Primary (sage): `#4f6352`
  - Primary dark: `#3d4e3f`
  - Primary pale: `#e8ede9`
  - Text (ink): `#141917`
  - Text soft: `#242c25`
  - Border: `#e4e8e5`
  - Background: `#ffffff`
- Invoice header: sage background `#4f6352` with white text, logo top-left, INVOICE label top-right

**Bank details — ask the client's currency, then use the matching Wise account:**

**CHF / international:**
- Name: Matthieu Patrick Jammers
- IBAN: GB61 TRWI 2308 0145 5737 43
- Swift/BIC: TRWIGB2LXXX

---

## Step 3 — Calculate Amounts

If invoicing in IDR:
- IDR amount = USD amount × exchange rate
- Format: `X XXX XXX,00` (spaces as thousands separator, comma as decimal)

If invoicing in USD/EUR/CHF: display amounts directly in that currency.

---

## Step 4 — Generate the HTML Invoice

Use `Projects/Sales-Training/invoice-nirvana-001.html` as the canonical visual reference.

Key design rules:
- Header: Company name + address (left) | INVOICE label + number (right)
- If no address (Scalrize): show company name only
- Meta row: Date, Location (Bali), Concerns
- Bill To block: Client name + contact
- Items table: Description with subtitle | Price columns. Header row = light blue (#c8dce8). Body rows alternate #eef4f8 / #e4edf3.
- Totals block: Right-aligned, grand total row black (#1a1a1a) with white text
- Payment schedule table (if split): Show each installment, badge "Due Now" on first in amber (#e8a820)
- FX note (IDR only): Italic, small, below payment table: "Exchange rate: 1 USD = IDR X,XX on [Dth of Month, YYYY]" (spell out date in full, e.g. "5th of June, 2026")
- Bank details: use the correct profile from Step 2 based on sender and currency

---

## Step 5 — Save HTML and Export PDF

File naming: `invoice-[client-slug]-[NNN].html` / `.pdf`

Save HTML, then immediately export PDF using Chrome headless:
```
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless --disable-gpu \
  --print-to-pdf="[same path but .pdf]" \
  --print-to-pdf-no-header \
  "file:///[absolute path to .html]"
```

---

## Step 6 — Confirm

Report back:
- HTML + PDF saved at: `[path]`
- Amount due now: [amount in invoice currency]
- Exchange rate used (if IDR): 1 USD = IDR X,XX
